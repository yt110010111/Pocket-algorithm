All txt file is linear separable data, you can use pocket algo to separate it. If you want to access file, use 
python Pocket.py --path xxx.txt( ex: python Pocket.py --path data_30_1.txt) In data_2000_50wrong.txt, there're total 100
data in wrong side. If you know how to optimize this code, it's welome to PM me.
